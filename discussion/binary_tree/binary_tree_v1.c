// This is the first generic binary tree API that I thought was actually useful.
// It allows choosing the key and value types as well as the key comparison
// function as a macro.
//
// Features:
//
//  - Single line instantiation that allows choosing prefix, key type, key comparison
//    function and value type.
//
//  - Simple generic and closure-less iteration over node elements.
//
// Drawbacks:
//
//  - When iterating, the 'node' variable is created in the local scope, so we
//    can't call 2 iteration loops in the same scope that use the same varible
//    name. I don't really see a way of fixing this because C doesn't allow
//    different variable types in the initialization expression of for loops.
//    The user will need to either rename the variable in the loop, or wrap the
//    iteration in a local scope. I don't think this is much of a problem
//    compared to the usefulness of the single line instantiation and for-like
//    iteration.
//
//  - It would be nice to be able to iterate over nodes without asking for the
//    prefix. I don't see how to fix this.
//
//  - The key comparison macro requires 3 states. This is different than the
//    current sort API where we only ask for the user to tell when A is less
//    than B. Here we need to also distinguish when A is equal to B for 2
//    reasons, 1) to stop the key lookup and 2) so we don't overwrite pointers
//    and maybe leak memory. I think we may need to do the same for the sort API
//    if we want to guarantee a stable sort, but it's very convenient to be able
//    to just do '*a<*b'.
//
//    One thing we could do so it's nicer is require 2 macros IS_A_LT_B and
//    IS_A_EQ_B (or IS_A_GT_B). This can make instantiation in general nicer, at
//    the cost of making the use of strcmp() in these macros a uglier and less
//    performant as we would be calling it twice. Probably the right thing to do
//    is leave it as it is and let the user create a proper function if things
//    get ugly.
//    :3_way_comparison_needed
//
//  - We don't yet have a node removal API.

                  - Overwrite the existing value with the new one. The problem
                    is if values are pointers, then we could be leaking stuff

                  - Do nothing, but somehow let the caller know the key was
                    already there so we didn't insert the value they wanted.

// removed all the drawbacks of iterating nodes of tree: we have a single line
// for tree instantiation, we don't have a callback (and don't need closures).
//
// This is a HUGE improvement over what could have been the naive approach shown
// in use cases 2 and 3 of binary_tree_v0.c. In fact I like this pattern so much
// that I'm pretty sure I will be using it for linked lists and directory
// iteration too.
